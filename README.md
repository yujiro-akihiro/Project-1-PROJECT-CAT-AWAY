# Catwalk Chaos!

**Chaos on the runway! Just before the 2024 Spring Fashion Show, four vip guest kittens have invaded the red carpet! With only 20 seconds until the show starts, you, a brilliant programmer, must use your AirTag skills to guide these furry fashionistas to their rightful VIP seats in the "Cat Array."**

## Challenge

- Score points for each rescued cat (25 points per cat!).
